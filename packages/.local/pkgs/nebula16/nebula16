# - introduction
#
#   this script and the accompanying pacman hook handle
#   configs in the format of nebula16 when they're installed.
#
# - how to use and how it works
#
#   for instance, to install a custom /etc/unbound/unbound.conf in
#   a package, you have to install it as /etc/unbound/unbound.nebula16.conf .
#
#   that's all you have to do.
#
#   the pacman hook will then call this script, which will rename
#   unbound.conf to unbound.orig16.conf (if it exists), and install a
#   symlink in place of unbound.conf pointing to unbound.nebula16.conf .
#
#   upon the file unbound.nebula16.conf being removed (due to package update
#   or removal), unbound.orig16.conf will be renamed back to unbound.conf .

# footnote 1:
#   the return status of the whole '&&' statement will be false if
#   either the condition before the '&&' or the command after it is false,
#   so in this case we use an if clause to not return false if the condition
#   is false. thus the return status will be the that of the 'mv' command.
