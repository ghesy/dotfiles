# brief:
#   some programs have tray icons and should be reopened
#   by clicking the tray icon. with this script, you can launch AND
#   reopen the programs with one command, without using the mouse.
#
# usage:
#   trayrun PROGRAM [WINDOW_NAME] [PROCESS_NAME]
#
# function:
#   - if no PROCESS_NAME is running, run PROGRAM.
#   - otherwise, click on the program's tray icon that matches WINDOW_NAME.
#   note 1:
#     if any of the WINDOW_NAME or PROCESS_NAME are omitted,
#     value of PROGRAM is used in their place.
#   note 2:
#     WINDOW_NAME is matched against classname, class and name of the window.

# substitute $1 for absent values
set -- "${1:?}" "${2:-$1}" "${3:-1}"

# exec the program if it isn't running
pidof -q "$3" || exec "$1"

# get windowid of my dwm's systray
id=$(xdotool search --classname systray)

# find the coordinates of the tray icon
coord=$(
    xwininfo -id "${id:?}" -tree -int |
        awk -v ptrn="$2" '
            $0 ~ ptrn { geom = $NF }
            END { gsub("+", " ", geom); print geom }
        '
)

# click on the icon
xdotool mousemove ${coord:?} mousemove_relative 10 10 click 1 mousemove restore
