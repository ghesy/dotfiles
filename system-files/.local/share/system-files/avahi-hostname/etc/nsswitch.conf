# Avahi provides local hostname resolution using a "hostname.local" naming scheme.
# To enable it, **install the nss-mdns package** and start avahi-daemon.service.
# Then, edit the file /etc/nsswitch.conf and change the hosts line
# to include mdns_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] before resolve and dns:
hosts: ... mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns ...
